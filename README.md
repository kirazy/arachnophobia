# Arachnophobia

**Making the Spidertron friendly for individuals with arachnophobia**  
This mod provides tools to the arachnophobic player to change the number of legs on the Spidertron, or hide them alltogether.

**Suggestions and Bug Reports**  
I want to make this as accessible and supportive as possible, if you would like to see additional features or changes, please do let me know on the [mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/arachnophobia/discussion), [forums](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=190&t=88051), or an [issue](https://github.com/kirazy/arachnophobia/issues) here on GitHub. I am also on the Factorio Discord (Kira#1860).

## Settings

*Written for version 1.0.3, which is ready, pending deployment of a fix for crash-issues related to loading saves with existing Spidertrons after changing the number of legs.*

* **Number of legs**  
Choose how many legs are displayed, selecting from two (2) legs through to eight (8) legs. [Click here for a preview of all seven configurations; warning: 8 legged version is present.](https://i.imgur.com/Ug2S2Zc.png)

* **Leg Display Style**  
Choose how legs are displayed by hiding them, replacing the Spidertron's legs with laser-pointers at the feet, or leaving them visible. [Click here for a preview of the three settings; warning: 8 legged version is present.](https://i.imgur.com/PnJ4rOX.png)
  
* **Display dust particles**  
Some players may prefer to have dust particles, even with invisible legs, but for those that do not, toggle them off using this setting.
  
* **Mute legs**  
Silence the sound of the legs in motion.
