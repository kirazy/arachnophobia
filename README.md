# Arachnophobia

**Making the Spidertron friendly for individuals with arachnophobia**  
Provides configuration options to make the Spidertron playable for arachnophobic players. By default, hides the legs of the Spidertron, displaying laser-pointers at the feet. Includes new options to customize the color of the lights, the number of the lights, and to change the number of legs as an alternative to hiding them.
